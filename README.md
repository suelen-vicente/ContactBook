# ContactBook

This is a simple Contact Book for iOS made in Swift and using API.
This app was subject of study in my post-graduation program.
The public API used to fill contacts was https://reqres.in/api/users

3 - When User clicks on the + icon on the top right, a new menu is displayed.<br> 
In this menu they can add a new user (which may or may not exist in API library). <br>
They can also load all contacts saved in API (those contacts will be displayed as a list of emails)<br>
User can remove all users from their list. This will not reflect on API database.<br>
